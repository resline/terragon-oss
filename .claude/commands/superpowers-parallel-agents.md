# Dispatching Parallel Agents

## Overview

Delegate tasks to specialized agents with isolated context. When you have multiple unrelated failures or independent tasks, dispatch one agent per independent problem domain.

**Core principle:** Dispatch one agent per independent problem domain. Let them work concurrently.

## When to Use

- 3+ test files failing with different root causes
- Multiple subsystems broken independently
- Each problem can be understood without context from others
- No shared state between investigations

## When NOT to Use

- Failures are related (fix one might fix others)
- Need to understand full system state
- Agents would interfere with each other (editing same files)

## The Pattern

### 1. Identify Independent Domains

Group failures by what's broken - each domain is independent.

### 2. Create Focused Agent Tasks

Each agent gets:

- **Specific scope:** One test file or subsystem
- **Clear goal:** Make these tests pass
- **Constraints:** Don't change other code
- **Expected output:** Summary of what you found and fixed

### 3. Dispatch in Parallel

Use multiple Task tool calls in a single message.

### 4. Review and Integrate

- Read each summary
- Verify fixes don't conflict
- Run full test suite
- Integrate all changes

## Agent Prompt Structure

Good agent prompts are:

1. **Focused** - One clear problem domain
2. **Self-contained** - All context needed
3. **Specific about output** - What should agent return?

## Common Mistakes

- **Too broad:** "Fix all the tests" → agent gets lost
- **No context:** "Fix the race condition" → agent doesn't know where
- **No constraints:** Agent might refactor everything
- **Vague output:** "Fix it" → you don't know what changed
