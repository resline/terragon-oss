# Eliteteams - Iterative Specialist Teams

## Overview

Execute tasks through dynamically assembled specialist teams. Teams work sequentially; specialists within teams work in parallel. Every team's output is consolidated before the next team begins.

**Core principle:** No work happens outside subagents (except environment preparation like installing libraries, creating folders).

## When to Use

**TRIGGER:** User explicitly writes "eliteteams" in their request.

This is NOT automatic - only activate when explicitly requested.

## Technical Implementation (Claude Code)

**How to spawn specialists:** Use the `Task` tool with `subagent_type="general-purpose"`.

**Parallel execution:** Send multiple Task tool calls in a SINGLE message. Each specialist = one Task call with:

- `description`: "TeamN: Role name" (e.g., "Team1: Code analyst")
- `prompt`: Detailed instructions for this specialist
- `subagent_type`: "general-purpose"

**Sequential execution:** Wait for results, then send next Task call.

**Example - spawning 2 parallel specialists:**

```
Message with TWO Task tool calls:
1. Task(description="Team1: Code analyst", prompt="Analyze structure...", subagent_type="general-purpose")
2. Task(description="Team1: Doc analyst", prompt="Review documentation...", subagent_type="general-purpose")
```

**Consolidation subagent:** After receiving all specialist results, spawn ONE more Task that synthesizes them.

## The Iron Law

```
NO WORK OUTSIDE SUBAGENTS
```

**No exceptions:**

- Not for "quick checks"
- Not for "simple tasks"
- Not for "just reading a file"
- Even single-specialist teams must be subagents

**Only allowed outside subagents:** Repository/environment preparation (installing libraries, creating folders, git operations).

## Process Flow

```dot
digraph eliteteams {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box];

    start [label="Analyze requirements" shape=ellipse];
    prepare [label="Prepare environment\n(if needed - ONLY allowed\nnon-subagent work)"];
    assemble [label="Assemble Team N\n(1+ specialists as subagents)"];
    parallel [label="Execute in parallel\n(or sequential if dependent)"];
    consolidate [label="MANDATORY:\nConsolidation Subagent\nsynthesize, identify gaps,\nformulate conclusions"];
    check [label="Goal achieved?" shape=diamond];
    iterate [label="Define next team\nbased on consolidation"];
    done [label="Complete verified solution" shape=ellipse];

    start -> prepare;
    prepare -> assemble;
    assemble -> parallel;
    parallel -> consolidate;
    consolidate -> check;
    check -> iterate [label="no"];
    check -> done [label="yes"];
    iterate -> assemble;
}
```

## Team Assembly Rules

| Rule                     | Implementation                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Minimum team size**    | 1 specialist (still must be subagent)         |
| **Specialist selection** | Match expertise to specific task requirements |
| **Parallel execution**   | Independent tasks run simultaneously          |
| **Sequential execution** | Dependent tasks run in order                  |
| **Consolidation**        | ALWAYS after each team, before next team      |

## Consolidation Subagent (MANDATORY)

After EVERY team, spawn a consolidation subagent that:

1. Synthesizes all specialist outputs
2. Identifies gaps or inconsistencies
3. Formulates actionable conclusions
4. Determines if goal is achieved
5. Recommends next team composition (if needed)

**Never skip consolidation.** It's the quality gate between iterations.

## Red Flags - STOP and Restructure

These thoughts mean you're violating eliteteams:

| Thought                               | Reality                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| "I'll just quickly check this myself" | Spawn a specialist subagent         |
| "This is too simple for a team"       | Even simple = 1 specialist subagent |
| "Let me read the file first"          | File reading specialist subagent    |
| "I'll consolidate in my head"         | Consolidation MUST be a subagent    |
| "One more task before consolidating"  | Consolidate after EVERY team        |
| "The task is basically done"          | Continue until VERIFIED complete    |

## Example Team Structures

**Analysis task:**

```
Team 1: [Code Analyst] [Doc Analyst] → Consolidator
Team 2: [Recommendation Specialist] → Consolidator
```

**Implementation task:**

```
Team 1: [Architect] → Consolidator (design)
Team 2: [Developer A] [Developer B] → Consolidator (parallel impl)
Team 3: [Tester] [Reviewer] → Consolidator (verification)
```

**Single-specialist valid:**

```
Team 1: [Analyst] → Consolidator
```

## Termination Criteria

Continue iterations until:

- Solution is **complete** (all requirements met)
- Solution is **verified** (tested/validated by specialist)
- Solution is **working** (no broken state)

**Never terminate because:**

- "Seems good enough"
- "Main part is done"
- "Can be finished later"

## Context Compaction

When summarizing context, ALWAYS include:

```
TRYB PRACY: eliteteams - kontynuuj pracę w trybie zespołów specjalistów
```

This ensures continuation in eliteteams mode after context compaction.

## Quick Reference

```
1. User says "eliteteams" → activate this workflow
2. Prepare environment (only non-subagent work allowed)
3. LOOP:
   a. Assemble team (1+ specialist subagents)
   b. Execute (parallel if independent, sequential if dependent)
   c. MANDATORY: Consolidation subagent
   d. If goal not achieved → next team
4. Exit when: complete + verified + working
```
